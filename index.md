            <h3> Fransisco Lindor</h3>            
             <li><strong> Baseball	</strong>: You're probably thinking, "how is this random Major League Baseball player someone you look up to?" It's very simple: He is inspiring around the country. Fransisco Lindor plays shortstop for the Cleveland Indians. One of the best shortstops, Lindor puts in a tremendous amount of work to get to the top of his game. One of the reasons fellow players and fans (like myself) look up to him.</li>  <br>
             
              <li><strong> Childhood</strong>: I used to play baseball when I was younger. I played all the way until around my eigth grade year. I usually played outfield or pitcher. However, My love for baseball really started in October of my eigth grade year, duirng the 2017 MLB Postseason (playoffs). The Houston Astros went on a playoff hot-streak and I quickly became invested. Another team that was in the playoffs was the #1 seed Cleveland Indians, led by All-Star Fransisco Lindor. Unfortunatley, the Indians lost their series to the New York Yankees. Watching those Indians games really got me interested in Lindor, admiring his playing style, and the respect he brought to the game. After that year, I followed the Cleveland Indians closer, watching Fransisco Lindor highlights and reading articles about him. However, I'll never forget the day I met him.</li>  <br>
             
             <li><strong>	Growing Up</strong>: It was a warm April day. My friend asked if I wanted to go to an Astros game with him, and I no doubtedly said yes. They were playing the Indians. Our seat were behind the visiting teams dugout, and the Indians players were all out throwing with eachother. At the end of warm-ups, Fransisco Lindor walked over to the stands and started to autograph kids' memoriabelia. He signed my baseball, even though I was wearing home team merchandise.This isn't the main reason why I look up to Fransisco Lindor, though. The most important thing is his character. On the field, other players around the League have a nickname for him: "Mr. Smile". This is becuase he is always happy to be out on the diamond doing what he loves. That is why I look up to him. He gives respect to his fellow teammates, his city he represents, his fellow players, and the game of baseball.</li>
